<!-- About -->
# About

This is an inventory management system which simulates a real-life Nike warehouse, allowing store managers to perform stock-taking with ease. The system is built using OOP, providing an efficient and user-friendly experience.

In **inventory.txt**, you will find data on various Nike shoes such as country, code, product, cost, quantity and value.
The purpose of the **inventory.py** program is to read this data and provide functions which allow the user to:
- search products by code
- determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it
- determine the product with the highest quantity to put on sale
- calculate the total value of each stock item
